## Domain 2 - Asset security

- Asset security includes the concepts, structures, principles, and controls aimed at protecting assetsâ€”anything of value to the organization.
- Domain 2 gives an overview of the steps involved in asset security to address some of the issues that security professionals often encounter while implementing them.

#### Asset classification

- Asset classification policies, procedures, and processes help achieve proper protection of assets
- Protection of assets should always be based on the value of the asset.
- Proper asset classification ensures that assets receive an appropriate level of protection based on the value that they represent to the organization. Asset classification can be defined as assigning assets the level of protection they require, based on their value to the organization.

- Who is the owner of the asset? --> ultimately accountable for ensuring their assets are classified and thus protected appropriately

#### Information classification benefits
- Identification of critical information: identifies information that the organization considers critical to business success..
- Identification of sensitivity to modification: classification helps identify data that must only be modified in specifically authorized ways.
- Commitment to protect valuable assets: creates awareness among users that the organization is committed to protecting assets from unauthorized access.
- Commitment to confidentiality where applicable: classification helps ensure that sensitive information remains confidential.

#### Classification process
- Begins with a detailed asset inventory
- Asset owners determine the classification assigned to an asset
- Is an ongoing process

| | Clasification vs Categorization| |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Clasification | System of classes ordered according to value | Top secret, secret, Company restricted, Proprietary,Personally Identifiable Information (PII)
| Categorization | The act of sorting into defined classifications

#### Labeling and marking
- Labeling refers to the classification of the asset and is system-readable
- Marking refers to the handling instructions of the asset and is human-readable
- Should be consistently applied to all assets within an organization
- Labeling should be cost-effective
  - Labeling methods: metadata, barcodes, qr, rfid, gps tags

#### Media handling
- Handling requirements are based on the classification of the asset, not the type of media    
- Owners determine who may access media, especially sensitive media
- Media Storage
  - top-secret data --> encrypted with robust algorithm (AES-256)
