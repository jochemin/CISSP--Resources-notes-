- Ethics are based on doing nothing that is harmful to anyone else    
- For organizations to have consistent ethics, they must be codified in corporate laws (policies)


| **(ISC)Â² Code of Ethics Canons** |  |
| --- | --- |

- Security must support the business in achieving its goals and objectives
- Security must increase the value of the organization
- Security focuses on anything that represents value, better referred to as assets, and implements controls that ultimately increase the value of those assets. Security should not focus only on information, or data, as this is just one example of assets that represent value to organizations and therefore need to be protected based on that value.
