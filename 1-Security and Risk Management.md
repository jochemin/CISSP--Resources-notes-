- Ethics are based on doing nothing that is harmful to anyone else    
- For organizations to have consistent ethics, they must be codified in corporate laws (policies)


| **(ISC)² Code of Ethics Canons** |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.
| 2 | Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.
| 3 | Provide diligent and competent service to principals.
| 4 | Advance and protect the profession.

- Security must support the business in achieving its goals and objectives
- Security must increase the value of the organization
- Security focuses on anything that represents value, better referred to as assets, and implements controls that ultimately increase the value of those assets. Security should not focus only on information, or data, as this is just one example of assets that represent value to organizations and therefore need to be protected based on that value.

</p>

| CIA Triad | Core pillars of security|
| --- | --- |
| Confidentiality | Protects assets using important principles such as need-to-know and least privilege; prevents unauthorized disclosure
| Integrity | Protects and adds value to assets by making them more accurate, more timely, more current, more meaningful; prevents unauthorized or accidental changes to assets such as information
| Availability | Protects critical assets based on value to ensure organizational assets are available when required by stakeholders

Too much confidentiality = difficulty to access data = reduced availability
Too much Integrity = slow down access = Cause delay in data usage = affects availability.
Too much availablity = Confidentiality and integrity will suffer

The traditional pillars of security have been increased to include

| CIA Triad | Core pillars of security|
| --- | --- |
| Authenticity | Proves assets are legitimate and bona fide, and verifies that they are trusted and verified. Proves the source and origin of important valuable assets. Also referred to as “proof of origin.”
| Nonrepudiation | Provides assurance that someone cannot dispute the validity of something; the inability to refute accountability or responsibility. Also, inability to deny having done something.

____

- The goal of governance is to enhance organizational value
- Corporate governance is based upon the goals and objectives of the organization
- Security must be managed top down instead of bottom up
- Scoping and tailoring are used to align security objectives with organizational goals and objectives
- Security governance must be aligned with corporate governance
- Scoping and tailoring
  - Scoping looks at potential control elements and determines which ones are in scope—for example, security control elements that could adhere to applicable laws and regulations—and which ones are out of scope.
  - Tailoring looks specifically at applicable—in scope—security control elements and further refines or enhances them so they’re most effective and aligned with the goals and objectives of an organization. This is done from the perspective of each functional area. They should be cost-effective in relation to what they’re protecting, and they should ultimately help add value to the organization. When done well, security governance is completely aligned with corporate governance, and the goals and objectives of an organization can be fulfilled in a manner that is cost-effective and adds value.

| | OECD’s privacy guidelines
| --- | --- |
| Collection Limitation Principle | Limit the collection of personal data to only what is needed to provide a service, obtain the personal data lawfully and, where appropriate, with the knowledge or consent of the data subject
| Data Quality Principle | Personal data should be relevant, accurate, and complete, and it should be kept up to date
| Purpose Specification Principle | The purposes for which personal data is collected should be clearly specified at the time of collection
| Use Limitation Principle | Personal data should only be used based on the purposes for which it was collected and with consent of the data subject or by authority of law; in other words, if an organization says it has collected personal data for a specific purpose, they should only use the personal data for that purpose
| Security Safeguards Principle | Personal data should be protected by reasonable security safeguards against loss, unauthorized access, destruction, use, modification, etc. Essentially, security controls must be put in place, because privacy is unattainable without security.
| Openness Principle | The culture of the organization collecting personal data should be one of openness, transparency, and honesty about how personal data is being used and in what context.
| Individual Participation Principle | When an individual—data subject—provides personal data to an organization, that individual should have the right to obtain their data from the data controller as well as have their data removed. In other words, the individual should have the chance to participate or choose whether to share their personal information or withhold it. The term data subject refers to the individual to whom the personal data pertains.
| Accountability Principle | A data controller should be accountable for complying with the other principles. What this basically means is that an organization that collects personal data is now accountable for the protection of that information.

___

| | core elements of a PIA/DPIA
| --- | --- |
| Identify the need for a DPIA | Use legislative guidelines, like GDPR, European guidelines, federal and state laws, industry regulations, etc. to determine if a DPIA is required. If any doubt exists, it’s best to err on the side of caution and conduct an assessment.
| Describe the data processing | This involves two steps.  The first step answers questions such as:      How is data being collected/used?       Where is data being gathered from?       How much data is being gathered, and how many data subjects are involved?       Is this data being stored with any third-party entities?       What are the purposes of processing?       Are the interests of the data controller legitimate?  The second step considers information gathered via questions like those mentioned earlier and further defines the purpose—the what, how, and why—of data processing activities as they relate to the goals of the project
| Assess necessity and proportionality | Data processing activities should always correlate with what is actually required for the goals and objectives of a project. The DPIA should confirm this is the case, and this can be done by answering questions such as:       Does a legal basis for collected personal data exist?       Do data subjects have the right to opt out or in with relation to their personal data?       Does a precedent exist for the collecting and processing of data?       How are the rights of data subjects protected?
| Consult interested parties | As part of any DPIA, several key parties should be consulted, including the data protection officer, project stakeholders, and data subjects (or their legal representatives).
| Identify and assess risks | This step is critically important and likely the most important component of the DPIA, as it involves thoroughly assessing risks to personal data. While some risks might be project dependent, key considerations with any project should include asking:       Is data being stored in unsafe locations?       Are appropriate access control lists being utilized?       What data retention policies are currently in place?
| Identify measures to mitigate the risks | Once risks associated with a project have been identified, it’s imperative that corresponding steps to mitigate those risks be identified and implemented, based upon the cost-effectiveness of doing so. Additionally, this is where a defense-in-depth approach that involves the use of complete controls should be utilized to::       protect personal data from unauthorized internal and external access,       remove data that is no longer required, via relevant data retention policies and processes,       maintain visibility over personal data,       automate remediation action when and where possible for the sake of data removal, cleanup, and classification.
| Sign off and record outcomes | After risks and associated mitigation steps have been identified, all details should be documented and signed off on by relevant parties that could include the data protection officer, senior management, process and project stakeholders, and data subjects.
| Monitor and review | A PIA should be performed when necessary, especially when risk represented by personal data processing operations has changed. This fact points to the need for ongoing monitoring and review of operations, processes, and all facets of a business that involve handling of personal data.

___

- Policies don’t need to be reviewed every year, standards, procedures, baselines, and guidelines may need to be updated frequently

| | what each of these documents are meant to be used for
| --- | --- |
| Policies | Documents that communicate management’s goals and objectives       Provide authority to security activity       Define the elements, functions, and scope of security team       Must be approved and communicated       Corporate laws
| Standards | Specific hardware and software solutions, mechanisms, and products  Examples       Specific anti-virus software, e.g., McAfee       Specific access control system, e.g., Forescout       Specific firewall system, e.g,. Cisco ASA       Published guideline (e.g., ISO 27001) adopted by an organization as a standard.
| Procedures | Step-by-step descriptions on how to perform a task; mandatory actions  Examples       User registration or new hire onboarding       Contracting for security purposes       Information system material destruction       Incident response
| Baselines | Defined minimal implementation methods/levels for security mechanisms and products  Examples       Configurations for intrusion detection systems       Configurations for access control systems
| Guidelines | Recommended or suggested actions  Examples       Government recommendations       Security configuration recommendations       Organizational guidelines       Product/system evaluation criteria  (Note: Guidelines allow an organization to suggest something be done without making it a hard requirement and thus cause a negative audit finding)

___
| | Personnel Security Controls
| --- | --- |
| Job rotation | Job rotation is quite useful to protect against fraud and provide cross training. It entails rotating staff (especially individuals in key positions), so that an individual can’t commit fraud and cover it up. For example, if someone is a loans officer at a major bank and is responsible for approving loans, they can easily defraud the bank by constantly approving loans for known individuals who pass them money as a reward. However, if that individual is rotated to another role, this won’t be possible. In addition, this helps the organization to build personnel redundancy. If another staff member learns how to perform the loan officer’s job, this can greatly help if that individual decides to leave the company.
| Mandatory vacation | Mandatory vacation is a control also used by organizations to detect fraud. Employees are required to go on vacation for a set period of time, during which time another employee can step into the role and determine if any malicious or nefarious activity has taken place or is actively taking place.
| Separation of duties | Separation of duties is used to prevent fraud, by requiring more than one employee to perform critical tasks. A good example of this can be found in Accounts Payable/Vendor Management department. For new vendors to be set up to receive payments, at least two people are typically involved: one person to enter the vendor or payment information and another to confirm the vendor or approve the check. This way, a check can’t be submitted, reviewed, and processed by a single person, giving them an opportunity to commit fraud.
| Need-to-know and Least privilege | Least privilege ensures that only the minimum permissions needed to complete the work are granted to any employee. Need to know ensures that access to sensitive assets is restricted only to those who require the information to complete the work.

| | onboarding and offboarding processes
| --- | --- |
| Onboarding | Identity proofing (ability to identify individuals attempting to access a specific application or service)
| Termination/Offboarding | Signoff on policies and agreements       Access provisioning based on least privilege and Need-to-Know    Timely removal of access       Involuntary vs. voluntary

___
| | Risk Management Process
| --- | --- |
| Value | The first step is identifying the assets of the organization and ranking those assets from most to least valuable. This process is referred to as asset valuation, and the ranking of assets can be achieved via two methods or, most commonly, a combination of both:       Quantitative value analysis       Qualitative value analysis
| Risk Analysis | Determine the risks associated with each asset via the risk analysis process. Risks are identified by determining the specific threats (threat analysis) that could harm the asset, the vulnerabilities (vulnerability analysis) of the asset, what the impact would be if a threat manifests or a vulnerability is exploited, and the expected frequency of the risk occurring. Simple definitions of the four key components that must be identified as part of risk analysis follow:       Threat: Any potential danger to an asset (could be environment, physical, people, technology).       Vulnerability: Any weakness that exists that could be exploited by an attacker.       Impact: The extent to which an asset would be negatively affected.       Probability/likelihood: The chance that a risk might materialize due to a given threat or vulnerability being present.  Based upon the findings from the risk analysis step, the next step is to rank the assets in order of the ones presenting the most risk to those with the least risk, using quantitative or qualitative analysis.
| Treatment | Once identified, risks must be dealt with (treated), and there are four risk treatment methods:       Avoid → Don’t do whatever the risky thing is (e.g., implementing a certain system, moving to the cloud, jumping off a bridge, etc.)       Transfer → Purchase an insurance policy (e.g., cyber insurance)       Mitigate → Implement controls to reduce the risk       Accept → The owner of an asset accepts a certain level of risk  See section 1.10.5 for additional details on risk treatment options.

___

- Risk can be managed via four approaches
  - Avoid --> Don't do it
  - Transfer --> Share some of the risk with another party
  - Mitigate --> Implement controls that reduce the risk to an acceptable level.
  - Accept --> No action or no further action where risk to a particular asset is concerned. This commonly happens when the cost of the control exceeds the value of the asset
- Risk can never be entirely eliminated

___

- A complete control is a combination of preventive, detective, and corrective controls
- In defense-in-depth (layered security), a complete control should be implemented at each layer

| | Types of Controls
| --- | --- |
| Directive | Direct, confine, or control the actions of subjects to force or encourage compliance with security policies. An example is a fire exit sign.
| Deterrent | Discourage violation of security policies. An example is a sign warning that a piece of land is private property and trespassers will be shot. Nothing prevents someone from walking past the sign, but it’s a good deterrent.
| Preventive | can prevent undesired actions or events. For example, a fence that prevents someone from walking onto a private property. Or not having flammable materials around and therefore preventing a fire from starting.
| Detective | Designed to identify if a risk has occurred. Importantly, detective controls operate after an event has already occurred. An example is a smoke alarm detecting smoke.
| Corrective | used to minimize the negative impact of a risk occurring—minimize the damage. They are used to alleviate the impact of an event that has resulted in a loss and to respond to incidents in a manner that will minimize risk. An example is a fire suppression system activating.
| Recovery | Designed to recover a system or process and return to normal operation following an incident. An example is a data backup policy allowing restoration of data on an affected server after an incident has taken place.
| Compensating | Compensating controls are typically deployed in conjunction with other controls to aid in enforcement and support of the other controls. However, compensating controls can also be used in place of another control to provide the needed security. An example is deploying a Host Intrusion Prevention System (HIPS) on a critical server, in addition to having a Network Intrusion Protection System (NIPS) operating on that server’s subnet. This way, if any offending traffic manages to slip by the NIPS tool, the HIPS on the server may still be able to prevent malware from damaging it.

- Categories of controls
  -  Administrative: Policies, procedures, baselines
  -  Physical: Doors, fences, gates, bollards, mantraps, guards, and CCTV
  -  Logical/technical: Firewalls, IPS/IDS, AV, antimalware, proxies
- Safeguards = proactive
- Countermeasures = reactive
  
#### Control types and categories
  
| | Administrative | Logical / Technical
| --- | --- | --- |
| Directive | Policy, Procedure | Configuration standards
| Deterrent | Guideline | Warning banner
| Preventive | User registration procedure | Login mechanism (security kernel)      Operating system restrictions    Fence       Radio Frequency (RF) ID badges
| Detective | Review violation reports | SIEM system
| Corrective | Termination | Unplug, isolate, and terminate connection    Fire suppression system
| Recovery | DR plan | Backups
| Compensating | Supervision, Job rotation, Logging | CCTV, Keystroke logging

- Risk Management Frameworks
  - NIST SP 800-37 (RMF) --> This guide describes the risk management framework (RMF) and provides guidelines for applying the RMF to information systems and organizations.
  - ISO 31000 --> ISO 31000 is a family of standards relating to risk management. The scope of ISO 31000 is to provide best practice structure and guidance to all organizations concerned with risk management.
  - COSO --> Provides a definition to essential enterprise risk management components, reviews ERM principles and concepts, and provides direction and guidance for enterprise risk management.
  - ISACA Risk IT Framework --> ISACA’s Risk IT Framework contains guidelines and practices for risk optimization, security, and business value. The latest version places greater emphasis on cybersecurity and aligns with the latest version of COBIT.

| | Steps in the NIST SP 800-37 Risk Management Framework (RMF)
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Prepare to execute the RMF
| 2 | Categorize Information Systems  In this step, information systems are identified and categorized. It includes questions like “What do we have?”; “How does this system, its subsystems, and its boundaries fit into our organization’s business processes?”; “How sensitive is it?”; “Who owns it and the data within it?”  The purpose of this step is to determine any potential adverse impacts to the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of organizational operations and assets, thereby informing the organizational risk management process.
| 3 | Select Security Controls  After a risk assessment has been conducted, select, tailor, and document security controls necessary to protect the information systems. Security controls are management, operational, and technical safeguards or countermeasures embedded into information systems. They protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of those systems and the information contained therein; assurance provides evidence that the security controls within an information system are effective.
| 4 | Implement Security Controls  Activities at this step are based entirely on the controls selected in Step 2 and involve two key tasks: 1) implementing the selected controls in the security and privacy plans and 2) documenting the specific, baseline details of the control implementation. This latter task is critical and allows everybody to understand what controls exist and to understand the controls in the context of the larger operational framework of the organization.
| 5 | Assess Security Controls  Activities during this step help determine if the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and meeting the security and privacy requirements for the system and the organization.  This step involves formulation of a comprehensive plan that must be reviewed and approved.
| 6 | Authorize Information System  This step requires senior management to decide whether it’s acceptable to operate the system in question, given the potential risk, controls, and residual risk. In addition to determining if the risk exposure is acceptable, Senior Management should review the plan of action related to remaining weaknesses and deficiencies—the residual risk. Finally, this authorization or approval is usually given for a set period of time that is often tied to milestones in the Plan of Actions & Milestones (POA&M), which facilitates tracking and status of failed controls.
| 7 | Monitor Security Controls  Continuous monitoring of programs allows an organization to maintain the security of an information system over time, adapting to changing threats, vulnerabilities, technologies, and mission/business processes. Milestones from the Authorize step are a key component of the Monitor step, which can also be considered the “continuous improvement” stage. During the Monitor step, questions like “Are the controls still effective?” and “Have new vulnerabilities developed?” are examined. Risk management can become near real-time using automated tools, although automated tools are not required. This helps with configuration drift and other potential security incidents associated with unexpected change on different core components and their configurations.

- Threat modeling is used to systematically identify, enumerate, and prioritize threats related to an asset
- Threat Modeling Methodologies
  - STRIDE --> developed by Microsoft. Thread-focused methodology.
    - S --> Spoofing --> Authentication
    - T --> Tampering --> Integrity
    - R --> Repudiation --> Nonrepudiation
    - I --> Information Disclosure --> Confidentiality
    - D --> Denial of Service --> Availability
    - E --> Elevation of Privilege --> Authorization
  - PASTA --> Process for Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis
    - Define Objectives—This considers the inherent application risk profile and addresses other business impact considerations early.
    - Define Technical Scope—The philosophy behind this stage is that you can’t protect what you don’t know. It’s intended to decompose the technology stack that supports the application components that realize the business objectives identified from Stage 1.
    - Application Decomposition—This stage focuses on understanding the data flows among application components and services in the application threat model.
    - Threat Analysis—Reviews threat assertions from data within the environment as well as industry threat intelligence that is relevant to service, data, and deployment model.
    - Vulnerability and Weakness Analysis—Identifies the vulnerabilities and weaknesses within the application design and code and correlates to see if it supports the threat assertions from the prior stage.
    - Attack Modeling—This stage focuses on emulating attacks that could exploit identified weaknesses/vulnerabilities from the prior stage. It helps to also determine the threat viability via attack patterns.
    - Risk and Impact Analysis—This stage centers around remediating vulnerabilities or weaknesses in code or design that can facilitate threats and underlying attack patterns. It may warrant some risk acceptance by broader application owners or development managers.
  - DREAD --> DREAD is a threat model primarily used to measure and rank the severity of threats. DREAD is often used in combination with the STRIDE model, where STRIDE identifies the threats, and DREAD is then used to rank the severity of threats
  
| Key Poing | Definition | Score | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| D | Damage | Total amount of damage the threat can cause? | 1-3
| R | Reproducibility | How easily can the threat be replicated? | 1-3
| E | Exploitability | How difficult is it to exploit the threat? | 1-3
| A | Affected Users | How difficult is it to exploit the threat? | 1-3
| D | Discoverability | How easily can the threat be discovered? | 1-3

- Social Engineering
  - Manipulation of people’s actions through intimidation and/or deception

|| Common forms of social engineering attacks|
| --- | --- |
| Phising | Phishing is where an attacker sends many emails with the hope that the target will open an email and click on a link or open a file that leads to a malicious action.
| Spear Phishing | Spear phishing is a targeted form of phishing that typically focuses on certain individuals or groups of individuals. Through a bit of discovery, the attacker determines what might prompt the targeted individual(s) to click on a link in an email, and the hook is then baited. A classic example is an attacker sending a malicious PDF posing as an invoice to the accounts payable team.
| Whaling | Like spear phishing, this is also an email attack and targets the big fish—the whales—in an organization. Typically, people like the CEO, COO, and CFO are the targets of a whaling attack.
| Smishing | Form of phishing that targets mobile phone users. Typically, an attacker purporting to be from a legitimate company sends a fraudulent text/SMS message to a potential victim, with the hope that the target will click a link in the message. Smishing attacks can be simple, with the hope that a victim will click on a link and then reveal sensitive information, or they can be sophisticated and allow the attacker to control the victim’s phone and thereby gain access to bank accounts, corporate resources, and other sensitive material.
| Vishing | another form of phishing, and the name refers to the way it is typically presented to a potential victim—via voice over IP (VoIP) phone systems (though attacks can take place over mobile phones, landlines, or voice mail).
| Pretexting | Pretexting involves the attacker creating a scenario, almost like a script, that very ingeniously and subtly spurs the victim into action. Usually, the pretext will strike an emotional chord—whether it’s your “bank” calling with news about suspicious activity related to your account, or a “friend” texting you with news about an unfortunate incident that’s left them stranded someplace. Ultimately, a request is made for money, sensitive information, or both.
| Baiting | Form of social engineering that preys on people’s curiosity via the use of physical tools, like USB drives. Usually, the attacker will drop some USB drives in a building parking lot, a hallway, a convention hall, or other crowded area. Then, some employees, hotel guests, or convention attendees will find the device and plug it in to their computer to try and identify the owner and return it.
| Tailgating and Piggybacking | Tailgating or piggybacking is the action of following a person who is authorized to enter a restricted area through a door and thus gaining unauthorized access. The difference is that in tailgating the attacker possesses a badge that is fake but looks real. In piggybacking, the attacker doesn’t have any badge at all.
