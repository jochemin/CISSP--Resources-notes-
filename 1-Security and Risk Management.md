- Ethics are based on doing nothing that is harmful to anyone else    
- For organizations to have consistent ethics, they must be codified in corporate laws (policies)


| **(ISC)² Code of Ethics Canons** |  |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Protect society, the common good, necessary public trust and confidence, and the infrastructure.
| 2 | Act honorably, honestly, justly, responsibly, and legally.

- Security must support the business in achieving its goals and objectives
- Security must increase the value of the organization
- Security focuses on anything that represents value, better referred to as assets, and implements controls that ultimately increase the value of those assets. Security should not focus only on information, or data, as this is just one example of assets that represent value to organizations and therefore need to be protected based on that value.

| CIA Triad | Core pillars of security|
| --- | --- |
| Confidentiality | Protects assets using important principles such as need-to-know and least privilege; prevents unauthorized disclosure
| Integrity | Protects and adds value to assets by making them more accurate, more timely, more current, more meaningful; prevents unauthorized or accidental changes to assets such as information
| Availability | Protects critical assets based on value to ensure organizational assets are available when required by stakeholders

Too much confidentiality = difficulty to access data = reduced availability
Too much Integrity = slow down access = Cause delay in data usage = affects availability.
Too much availablity = Confidentiality and integrity will suffer

The traditional pillars of security have been increased to include

| CIA Triad | Core pillars of security|
| --- | --- |
| Authenticity | Proves assets are legitimate and bona fide, and verifies that they are trusted and verified. Proves the source and origin of important valuable assets. Also referred to as “proof of origin.”

- The goal of governance is to enhance organizational value
- Corporate governance is based upon the goals and objectives of the organization
- Security must be managed top down instead of bottom up
- Scoping and tailoring are used to align security objectives with organizational goals and objectives
- Security governance must be aligned with corporate governance
- Scoping and tailoring
  - Scoping looks at potential control elements and determines which ones are in scope—for example, security control elements that could adhere to applicable laws and regulations—and which ones are out of scope.
  - Tailoring looks specifically at applicable—in scope—security control elements and further refines or enhances them so they’re most effective and aligned with the goals and objectives of an organization. This is done from the perspective of each functional area. They should be cost-effective in relation to what they’re protecting, and they should ultimately help add value to the organization. When done well, security governance is completely aligned with corporate governance, and the goals and objectives of an organization can be fulfilled in a manner that is cost-effective and adds value.
